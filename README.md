# **Express.js Project Scaffolder: Rapid Backend Setup**

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the initialization of Express.js backend applications. It provides developers with a quick, opinionated, yet highly customizable starting point, allowing for the effortless scaffolding of projects with choices for programming language (JavaScript or TypeScript), database integrations (MongoDB or PostgreSQL), ORM/ODM selection (Mongoose or Drizzle ORM), and essential features like JWT authentication, Bcrypt password hashing, and Multer for file uploads. üõ†Ô∏è

## **Installation**

Getting this project up and running on your local machine is straightforward. Follow these steps:

*   **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/create-express-server.git
    ```
*   **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd create-express-server
    ```
*   **Install Dependencies**: This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager, as specified in `package.json`. If you don't have pnpm, you can install it globally via npm: `npm install -g pnpm`.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
*   **Link the CLI Tool (for local development/testing)**:
    To use `create-express-server` directly from your terminal, you can link it locally:
    ```bash
    pnpm link --global
    ```

Now, the `create-express-server` command should be available in your terminal!

## **Usage**

To create a new Express.js project using this CLI, simply open your terminal in the directory where you want to create your new project and run the command:

```bash
create-express-server
```

You will be guided through an interactive prompt where you can configure your new Express.js application. The CLI will ask you to specify:

*   **Project Name**: The name for your new backend project.
*   **Language**: Choose between JavaScript and TypeScript.
*   **Database**: Select either MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
*   **ORM/ODM**: Based on your database choice, select Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Drizzle ORM (for PostgreSQL).
*   **Authentication**: Option to include JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
*   **Password Hashing**: Option to include Bcrypt.js for secure password hashing.
*   **File Uploads**: Option to include Multer for handling file uploads.

After answering the prompts, the CLI will scaffold a new Express.js project in a subdirectory with the chosen name, pre-configured with your selections.

**Example Flow (Illustrative):**

```bash
? What is the name of your project? (my-new-express-app)
? Which language would you like to use? (Use arrow keys)
  JavaScript
‚ùØ TypeScript
? Which database would you like to use? (Use arrow keys)
  MongoDB
‚ùØ PostgreSQL
? Which ORM/ODM would you like to use? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Drizzle ORM
  Mongoose
? Do you want to include JWT for authentication? (y/N) y
? Do you want to include Bcrypt.js for password hashing? (y/N) y
? Do you want to include Multer for file uploads? (y/N) n

‚ú® Creating my-new-express-app...
üéâ Project 'my-new-express-app' created successfully!
```

Once your project is generated, navigate into its directory (`cd my-new-express-app`) and run `pnpm install` to install its specific dependencies, then `pnpm dev` to start the development server.

## **Features**

This CLI tool comes packed with features designed to accelerate your backend development workflow:

*   üöÄ **Rapid Project Scaffolding**: Quickly set up a new Express.js project in seconds.
*   üåê **Language Choice**: Seamlessly generate projects in either JavaScript or TypeScript, catering to different team preferences and project requirements.

*   üîë **Authentication Ready**: Built-in option to integrate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for robust authentication mechanisms.
*   üîí **Secure Password Hashing**: Include Bcrypt.js for best-practice password security right from the start.
*   üì§ **File Uploads**: Easily add Multer support for handling multipart/form-data, perfect for file and image uploads.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Middlewares**: Pre-configured common Express.js middlewares like CORS, Morgan for logging, and body parsers.
*   üìÅ **Modular Structure**: Generated projects follow a clean, modular structure, making them easy to navigate, extend, and maintain.
*   Linting and Formatting: Includes ESLint and Prettier configurations for consistent code quality.
