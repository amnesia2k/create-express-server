# **Express Server CLI: Rapid Express.js Project Scaffolding** üöÄ

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don‚Äôt install this package manually!**  
> Use it like this instead:
>
> **`npx create-xpress-server@latest`**  
> or  
> **`pnpx create-xpress-server@latest`**  
> or  
> **`pnpm create create-xpress-server@latest`**
>
> Installing directly with `npm i create-xpress-server` will not do what you want. It's a CLI generator, not a library!

This project is a robust Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the setup of your Express.js backend applications. Say goodbye to repetitive boilerplate! Express Server CLI empowers developers to quickly scaffold new projects with customizable options for language (JavaScript or TypeScript), database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL), ORM/ODM (Mongoose or Drizzle ORM), and essential utilities like JWT authentication and Multer for file uploads. It's engineered to kickstart your development process efficiently, letting you focus on building core features right away.

## Usage üí°

Express Server CLI is designed to be highly interactive and easy to use. Once installed, you can simply run the command and follow the prompts.

- **Interactive Mode**:
  The simplest way to use Express Server CLI is by running the command without any arguments. It will guide you through the setup process with a series of interactive prompts.

  ```bash
  pnpx create-xpress-server@latest
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  npx create-xpress-server@latest
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  pnpm create create-xpress-server@latest
  ```

  The CLI will prompt you for various configurations to tailor your new Express.js project:

  - **Project Name**: Define the name for your new Express.js application.
  - **Language**: Choose between **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** for your codebase.
  - **Database**: Select your preferred database: **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**.
  - **ORM/ODM**: The appropriate ORM/ODM will be automatically selected based on your database choice (Mongoose for MongoDB, Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL).
  - **Additional Features**: Opt to include powerful utilities like **JWT authentication** for secure routes, **Bcrypt.js** for robust password hashing, and **Multer** for efficient file uploads.

  After you've made your selections, Express Server CLI will generate a new, fully configured Express.js project in a fresh directory named after your chosen project name.
